# React Animated Sidebar with Framer Motion

This is a simple yet stylish sidebar navigation project built using React and powered by Framer Motion for smooth animations. The primary goal of this project is to create an elegant and interactive sidebar that can be easily integrated into web applications, providing a sleek user interface and enhancing the overall user experience.

### Acknowledgments

This project was created based on the knowledge gained from the tutorial "How to Create a Fully Animated Sidebar in React.js using Framer Motion" by [Yazdun Fadali](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/yazdun/). The tutorial provided valuable insights and guidance on creating animated sidebars in React, and I highly recommend checking it out for a more in-depth understanding of the concepts used in this project.
